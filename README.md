# HCI-BLE-Python
Python library to access BLE functions using HCI layer   

Very simple, using the BLE commands directly without any interpretation or pythonic class creation    

Credits: based on work in Scapy, Bumble and python-hcipy

Simple use of the HCI layer to run BLE commands using python.   
Tested on Ubuntu using Bluez and a KinivQ USB dongle. Some other dongles didn't work.   

Key learning - you need to stop Bluez interfering, and you need to bring the hci device down to do that - and open as a User socket.   Scapy has special code for that.
  
**The BLE HCI interface**   

The BLE HCI interface is packet based and has three relevant packet types - command, asynchronous data and event.   
The formats are shown in the diagrams below.   
Each packet starts with the event type as the first byte ('octet' in BLE specification documentation).
